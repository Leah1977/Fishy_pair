## Dropdown menu not working 

I had added some extra bootstrap links to the bottom of the index.html page.  They were unneccessary as I had already add the bundle.  
This caused some doubling up.

With some help from Kevin in tutor support, I removed the unneccesary links

## Gameboard was misaligning

I had a positioning issue with my gameboard.  The cards were aligning too far to the left.
I adjusted my display in css to relative instead of absolute.  
This helped with the positioning.
