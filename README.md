## Introduction


## Welcome!

### This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)/.

I have created a mobile-first project.

FISHY PAIRS

My project is all about having fun while reinforcing some early learning skills to improve the cognitive development of a young child.
Fish pairs is a memory game.  It is aimed to encourage children to improve their memory recall while having fun.
The game will increase in difficulty as the child progresses through the levels.

### What value does it provide to its users
This game encourages the cognitive development of young children.
We are improving our memory skills.
It provides a fun platform for learning.
The game is designed for short sessions of gameplay in which the child can interact with a game while learning.

### What value does it provide to the site owner – I enjoy playing the game myself with family.
It is a way to interact with young children and lead to independent play as the child progresses.
The game can be enjoyed as an adult with a young child as fun. The creative element will promote engagement.


### Here is a demonstrating of how my website looks on different screen sizes using [Am I Responsive Website](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

![Am I responsive](assets/images/readmeimages/responsivegame.png)

The game will resize according to the different screen sizes.

---
#### This project will include four separate pages.  

* Home page with the game
* How to play page with pop up feedback “well done” “better luck next time.”
* Sign up Form
* 404 page, which has a link back to the home page without using browser navigation.

## Home page
 
The home page is made up of the title “Fishy Pairs”.
There is an overlay to start the game.
The matching game.
There is a drop-down, select menu.

![dropdown menu option](assets/images/readmeimages/dropdown.png)

The home page displays an overlay that is clicked to start the game.  

## How to Play Page

The  How to Play page has a list of clear instructions on how to play the game. 
There is also a close button to close the modal and a link back to the home page to play the game.

![How To Play](assets/images/readmeimages/howtoplay.png)



## Game section.

- The player will click on the play button to enter the game.

- Here, there will be a set number of cards displaying face down and of identical appearance.

- There will be a timer at the top, a moves counter and a refresh icon over the cards.

- Once the player clicks on the start button, the timer will start.  There will be a set time to play the game.

- The player must choose two cards

  - If they match – the cards will remain open, and the player may continue to choose another two cards.

  ![Cards Match](assets/images/readmeimages/gameplay.png)

  - If they do not match, the cards will return to a face down, and the player may try again.
  

  - If the time runs out before all the cards are matched, a “Hard Luck” pop up will show.
  ![Game Over!! Better Luck Next Time!](assets/images/readmeimages/gameover.png)

  - If all the cards are matched before the time runs out, the player will be congratulated. 
  ![Congratulations! You Won!!](assets/images/readmeimages/youwon.png) 
  ![You won](assets/images/readmeimages/youwongameplay.png)


## Sign up Form

This page will allow the player to sign up for further information on updates for our game application.
![Sign Up](assets/images/readmeimages/signup.png)


The sign-up form is to register with our site to be notified of other games or updates.


## Features left to implement
I would like to include a section to become a member of our fish pairs club.

As I develop and improve my JavaScript skills, I would like to include options to change the game’s difficulty level.

# UX

## Skeleton:


### I have used Balsamique to draw up 3-page wireframes for Mobile, iPad and Desktop.

### Click here for a link to the Wireframes [Balsamique Fishy_Pairs](assets/wireframes/game_wireframe.pdf)

## Project Goals.

### This project provides an interactive matching game. They are intended for enjoyment.

* To engage with the user for a set amount of time.
* To allow the user to exit the game at any stage.
* To allow the user to restart the game.

## Strategy


### This website is for users looking to interact with a matching game. 
* I want to provide a fun and enjoyable game for a young child.
* I want the instructions to be easy to follow.
* I want the user to navigate the site with ease.

* Would you find this game easy to understand?
* Would you like sound when playing?
* Would you like to see your score?
* Would you like to choose the timer length?
* Would you like to record your score?
* How long do you think you would like the game to last?


## User Story 1

### What I expect to find on a matching game?
 
1. I expect to be able to navigate around the game with ease.
2. I expect to be able to choose my level of play.
3. Since this is an interactive game, I expect to click on a card and for the image to turn over to display a picture.  
4. Can I restart the game during play? I want to be able to change levels, continue the game or quit at any stage.

## User Story 2

 As a website user, I want a game to challenge me.  I would expect to choose my level of difficulty and for the gameplay to match the level.

### What I expect to find on a web application game.

1. Does it increase with difficulty as I progress through the game?
2. Will the game congratulate me?
3. What do other customers say about them?

## User Story 3

### Would this game be suitable for an older child.

1. Is the game rewarding?
2. Will the game keep me interested?
3. What age is the game intended for?

As a user, I would like to challenge myself and see a record of my previous scores.

## User Story 4

### Would this game be suitable to play with a young child?

1. Is the game easy to navigate?
2. Is it a quick game?
3. Are there educational advantages to playing this game?

As a user, I would like to play this game with my son/daughter.  I would like them to be able to engage with the game.
I want the game to help with their memory skills.

With these user stories in mind, I put together some wireframes.  I included all the primary requirements and issues that were raised from my user story research.


## Scope

### Essentials will include

* Restart button
* Exit button
* Timer
* you completed the game announcement/modal

## Features

#### This project will include four separate pages.  

* Home page
* How to play page with pop up feedback “well done”, “better luck next time.”
* Sign up Form

## Color Scheme

### I will use the colours in the main body, header and footer

![Color Scheme](assets/images/readmeimages/colours.png)

My primary colours will be blue-violet and aqua.  I will use variations of this colour to add designs that stand out and appeal to the user.


I used [Coolers](http://www.coolers.co) to generate my colours for the project. I then used variations within the project.

## Typography

### I will use the following fonts throughout the website for consistency in style.

 * Eczar
![Eczar Font](assets/images/readmeimages/eczar.png)

I chose this font style to catch the attention of the user when the game loads

 ![Play Game Overlay](assets/images/readmeimages/startgame.png)

 * Rubik

 ![Rubik Font](assets/images/readmeimages/rubik.png)


 I chose this for the main game title.
